## Background



## Scenario



## Purpose

The aim of this activity is to gain insight into the experiences of autistic people who use health and social care services; to reflect on reasonable adjustments that could be made collaboratively to improve accessibility for autistic people.


## Audience

- Student health and social care professionals.
- Patient/service user-facing staff working in health and social care environments.


## Learning outcomes

- Identify and discuss sensory challenges in the waiting room environment.
- Reflect on your experience and devise an action plan for future development that promotes inclusion and wellbeing for people in your care.
- Identify and discuss different styles of social communication and interaction.

## Briefing

You are attending your appointment at a local outpatientsâ€™ clinic for a medication review. Your partner had to work today, so this is the first time you are attending the clinic on your own.  You have spent the morning preparing what you want to say to the doctor, because you have some important thoughts about side effects you have been experiencing.

## Activities

**Task 1**: Learners get into pairs or groups of 3-4. Before engaging with the virtual reality hardware, spend a few minutes as a group discussing your experiences of autism and neurodivergence. You may choose to share lived experience, either as an autistic individual, a carer, or as a student healthcare professional. Choose one group member to collate key words and notes in a shared document/padlet for review at the end of the session. 

**Task 2**: Learners enter the virtual waiting room in turn. Complete the experience, noting anything that stands out to you as potentially challenging in terms of sensory information. 

**Task 3**: Once all learners have completed the experience, debrief using the questions below as a guide.


## Debriefing

- What were your feelings before entering the waiting room? During the experience? And what are your feelings afterwards?
- Discuss what you think might be the most challenging elements of the experience for autistic people, people with sensory processing differences, and/or other neurodivergences?
- What will you do differently in your practice moving forward to promote inclusion for people in your care? Utilise the SMART acronym (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-based) to generate an action plan. 

## Evaluation

- This activity is formative in nature; an action plan is generated that enables students to reflect on and develop their understanding and practice when supporting this service user group in future placements/practice.
- Action plans could be peer-reviewed with guidance from facilitator for accurate use of SMART principles.
