# Setting up the environment

## Installation

Install the following software:
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).[^1]

## Setting up Git

The first thing you should do after installing Git is to set your user name and email address. This is important because every Git commit uses this information to identify who contributed the change.[^2] Configure your Git username and email:
   1. Open a Terminal
   2. Type `git config --global user.name "John Doe"` and press Enter.
   3. Type `git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com` and press Enter.

## Github

1. Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).

## Setting up Visual Studio Code

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** (VS Code) from your menu. Don't do anything here yet.
2. Navigate to the [VR-in-HPE repository](https://github.com/Altavako/vr-in-hpe) in your browser.
3. Click on the green **Clone** button, and copy the URL under the HTTPS tab.
4. Go back to VS Code and choose **Clone Git repository** from the options on the Welcome page.
5. Paste the URL from the VR-in-HPE repository into the field that appears at the top of VS Code.
6. Choose a location to clone (i.e. copy) the files from the GitHub repository onto your computer.
7. Install the **Markdown All in One** extension.

## Markdown

All of the content in this project is written in Markdown, which makes it really simple to create HTML. You should [familiarise yourself](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) with the syntax.
